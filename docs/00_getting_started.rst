Getting started - Choosing a Notebook
*********

Each experiment has different notebook options when starting a server and are grouped into the following: LBNF/DUNE/ProtoDUNE, FIFE/Neutrinos, ACORN/ACCEL-AI, Cosmic Frontier, CMSLPC, and Fermi Generic SL7. In general, only the notebooks where the user has an associated experiment should be available when selecting which to open. Users will also have access to the Fermi Generic SL7 notebooks.

`CMSLPC`_ - CMS, LHC

`Cosmic Frontier`_ - LSST, MAGIS-100, Mu2e, DES, DarkSide, Holometer

`ACORN/ACCEL-AI`_ - 

`FIFE/Neutrinos`_ - LArIAT, NOvA, MicroBooNE, MINERvA, ICARUS, SBND

`LBNF/DUNE/ProtoDUNE`_ - DUNE, LBNF

`Fermi Generic SL7/CC8`_ - Muon g-2
