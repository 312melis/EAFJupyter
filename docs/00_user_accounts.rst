General Usage
==============
CMS USERS/VISITORS PLEASE GO TO :ref:`cms-label` IF YOU HAVE ALREADY OBTAINED A GENERAL ACCOUNT

The EAF requires users to have a Fermilab services account which can be obtained in different ways depending on your affiliation with Fermilab. The links to instructions are provided for users and visitors looking to obtain a general Fermilab account. If you are offsite, you will also need to use the Fermilab VPN to connect to the EAF, follow `these instructions <https://fermi.servicenowservices.com/wp/?id=evg-kb-article&sys_id=567a699a1b73f0104726a8efe54bcbe3>`_ if you have not used the VPN before or are having trouble with it.

If you already have a Fermilab account and are still having trouble please contact <email> or take a look at the Common Issues section of this documentation.
