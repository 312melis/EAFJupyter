EAF Access and Accounts
*********

General Usage
==============
CMS USERS/VISITORS PLEASE GO TO `CMS ACCOUNTS <https://eafjupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/00_user_accounts.html#cms-accounts>`_

The EAF requires users to have a Fermilab services account which can be obtained in different ways depending on your affiliation with Fermilab. The links to instructions are provided for users and visitors looking to obtain a general Fermilab account. If you are offsite, you will also need to use the Fermilab VPN to connect to the EAF, follow `these instructions <https://fermi.servicenowservices.com/wp/?id=evg-kb-article&sys_id=567a699a1b73f0104726a8efe54bcbe3>`_ if you have not used the VPN before or are having trouble with it.

If you already have a Fermilab account and are still having trouble:

CMS Accounts
================

Obtaining accounts as a CMS affiliate is slightly different than obtaining a general Fermilab account since there are also CERN accounts to obtain. The link for the instructions is provided and guides through all the steps needed to have full access as a CMS memeber. The link provided has instructions for obtaining Fermilab and CMS LPC computing accounts, getting a badge for onsite access, getting CERN accounts, getting a personal grid certificate, and how to connect to the LPC. 

IMPORTANT: It can take 4-6 weeks for accounts to be approved.
